```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20+
- MongoDB (current database choice, can be changed as requirements evolve)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-api.git
   cd ecommerce-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Configure environment variables
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Run the application
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## 🔄 API Patterns

This framework supports multiple API implementation patterns:

| Pattern  | Best For                                          | Implementation Guide          |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| REST     | Simple CRUD operations, standard HTTP conventions  | [REST Guide](docs/rest.md)   |
| GraphQL  | Complex data relationships, client-specific needs  | [GraphQL Guide](docs/graphql.md) |

## 📊 Data Models

The platform includes essential e-commerce models:

- **User** - Authentication, profiles, roles
- **Product** - Items available for purchase
- **Category** - Product categorization
- **Cart** - Shopping cart functionality
- **Order** - Purchase tracking
- **Payment** - Transaction processing
- **Review** - Customer feedback
- **Inventory** - Stock management

## 🛡️ Security

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- HTTPS enforcement

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run specific tests
go test ./internal/services/product
```
