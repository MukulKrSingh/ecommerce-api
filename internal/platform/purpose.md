Purpose: Contains code for interacting with external "platforms" or infrastructure, such as databases, caching systems, message queues, or third-party APIs.

database:
Purpose: Database connection setup, ORM/SQL client initialization, and any database-specific utilities.
Examples: postgres.go (for PostgreSQL), mongodb.go (for MongoDB).

cache:
Purpose: Redis, Memcached, or other caching client setup and utilities.
Examples: redis.go.


external:
Purpose: Clients for third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, email services, SMS services).
Examples: paymentgateway.go.
Why: Isolates infrastructure concerns from business logic. If you swap databases, only files in this directory need to change significantly.
