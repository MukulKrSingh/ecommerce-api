Purpose: Defines your application's data structures (structs) that represent entities in your domain (e.g., User, Product, Order). These are often shared across layers (handlers, services, repositories).
Examples: product.go (Product struct), user.go (User struct), order.go (Order struct).
Why: Defines the "nouns" of your application.
